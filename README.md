# DD1351-Logic-for-Computer-Scientist
This is a mathematical course focusing on logic in mathematics. In this course there is also a laboratory part which is three different tasks to create programs in Prolog which can do different logical operations. The first lab is to learn the basics of Prolog. The second lab was to create a Prolog program that can evaluate different proofs in natural deduction and examine if they are true or false. The final lab was to create a Prolog program that different formulas in computational tree logic (CTL) is correct or not.
